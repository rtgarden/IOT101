New to GitHub:
==============

start out by getting a github account,

Install github on your desktop

using the spoon-knife tutorial become familiar with the basic concepts

used on the github site as we are using this distributed site as a base.

follow the connectIOT project

watch and star the IOT101 repository

To join IOT101:
================

fork the 101 repository,

clone it to your desktop.

configure remotes:

generally you want to create an upstream master and a working branch of a repository

this way the original repository is set as the "master" 

this is generally done in the terminal using 

* $ git remote add upstream *

the upstream master is like a pristine "version" and is often used in software version control

branching your repository in your local repository you can create your own working and pristine branches

when you want to update your master with material from the connect IOT master repository you will use

* $ git fetch upstream *

this will pull in changes not present in your local repository without modifying your files

in order o merge the changes and alter your repository with the changes:

* $ git merge upstream/master *

this will merge the changes into your local master copy

Branches are quite flexible and they can be used to organize collaboration.

Branches can be seperate into sections similar to chapters, 

The system of collaboration can also be shaped by how branches are shared, 

Subject categories and appendix lists can be created and shared through branching

allowing for the creation of a detailed reference which can have many editors and proof readers

Network visualization means you can follow along with each branch using the swim lane branching visualization.

Using git fetch to keep up with commits you can follow along as we update the textbook

in order to do the git fetch you will need to use your terminal (many operations can be done in terminal).

Using pull requests you can contribute to the collaborative effort, 

There are many ways to contribute to the overall effort, even simply helping correct simple errors.
